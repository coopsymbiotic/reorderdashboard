# reorderdashboard

Makes it possible to re-order the dashboard elements (including those defined by extensions).

The extension is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt).

## Requirements

* PHP v7.0+
* CiviCRM Latest

## Installation

Install as a regular extension.

## Usage

Go to `Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Re-order User Dashboard Elements`.

Enter the CSS elements of the elements that you want to prioritize. You do not need to enter them all, only the elements you want to prioritize (the left should be left in their existing order). Separate the elements by comma.

## Known Issues

If would be great if the elements could be re-order by some drag and drop way, but that would take more than the 30 minutes it took to write the extension.
